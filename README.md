# isomorphic-react-webpack-boilerplate

Boilerplate for an react application with webpack including server-side rendering, async loading of assets and hot updates.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/mariopeixoto/isomorphic-react-webpack-boilerplate.git
```

## Usage

```
npm start
```

### Production

```
npm run production
```

## Roadmap

Still need some improvements on the entry point js server render. The implemented way feels heavy handed.
